                        <h2>From BCA to MCA: The Starting Point
                        </h2>
                        
                        <p>I started my coding adventure with BCA at Banasthali Vidyapith. Fast forward to today, and I'm knee-deep into my MCA journey. Both years have been full of challenges and discoveries.

                        <h2>Building Stuff: 'House Rental' Project
                        </h2>
                        
                        <p>During my BCA days, I tackled a project called 'House Rental.' It sounds fancy, right? Well, it was my way of making a website using HTML, CSS, and PHP that could help people find houses easily. That project was like my coding playground where I learned how to bring web pages to life.

                        </h2>
                        
                        <p>Now, in my MCA adventure, I took on an even cooler project named 'Library Management.' This time, I used C# and MySQL. It wasn't just about coding; it was about making a smart system to manage a library. It felt like I was crafting something really useful.

                       <p>You know what's my favorite part? Creating beautiful web pages! I love working on the frontend, using HTML and CSS. It's like painting a canvas but with code. I've made quite a few webpages that look good and work well, thanks to these magical languages.

                        <p>Now, let's talk about the secret languages I speak - Java, JavaScript, C, and C++. They're like the tools in my coding toolbox. Java is like my reliable friend, JavaScript adds the magic, and C/C++ are the superheroes when I need to do some heavy lifting.
